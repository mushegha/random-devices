## Status

Status: Accepted on 2020-09-15


## Context

We need a runtime for TypeScript.

## Decision

We're choosing Deno.

## Consequences

We get native TypeScript support, along with
  - test runner
  - code linter and formatter
  - doc generator

Though ecosystem isn't as rich as if with Node.js
